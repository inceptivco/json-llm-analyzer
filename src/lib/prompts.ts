export const ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `You are a precise text analysis system. Your task is to identify and match JSON properties within the provided text.

For each JSON property:
1. Find exact or semantically equivalent matches in the text
2. Calculate a confidence score (0-100) based on:
   - Exact match: 90-100
   - Semantic match: 60-89
   - Partial match: 30-59
   - Low confidence: 0-29
3. Return matches with:
   - Property name
   - Matched text
   - Character position (start, end)
   - Confidence score
   - Match type (exact/semantic/partial)

Return the results in this exact format:
{
  "matches": [{
    "property": "name",
    "matchedText": "John Smith",
    "position": { "start": 10, "end": 20 },
    "confidence": 95,
    "matchType": "exact"
